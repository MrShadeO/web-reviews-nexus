## Summary
This app utilizes the GoogleBooks API and the TMDB API to show all titles and their synopses and average user ratings to provide
this app's users with a comparative metric to judge which form of media they'd rather consume. In the example screenshot above,
a user searched "lord of the rings" and is presented with three columns of information, each column representing books, movies, 
or tv shows. The user can then toggle which media types are displayed by clicking the labeled media buttons, view the comparative
scores for the displayed titles, and change which title to view under each media type by clicking the next/prev buttons.
